### Notes
I set myself a time limit of 6 hours on this, and my time is up. I re-used components I have built for my personal component library.  I am only doing validation on the first set of fields (basic info).  There may be little bugs here and there, but I'm assuming the main purpose was to see some UX/UI, so I spent my time focusing on that.

Much more time can be spent doing validation and error handling, if requested, I can do the rest of the spa.  In addition, the data only saves on submit.  Animation does a little skip if switching between the 3 tabs.  

I also did not style the CV, for the sake of time.  In the actual product, I assume we will have multiple templates as well, so this would be a template selection / preview page.
